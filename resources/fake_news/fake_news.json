    "Tom Hiddleston Stunned Taylor Swift Referenced Him On New Album: Here\u2019s Why\n\nWhile most of the people who are or were in Taylor Swift\u2019s life most likely knew they\u2019d be called out on her album, Tom Hiddleston thought he was safe! But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Here\u2019s what he thinks \u2026\n\n\nTom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, \u201cReputation\u201c. But, come on, Tom; anyone\u2019s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks \u2014 \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d and \u201cGetaway Car\u201d. And, since the pair didn\u2019t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would\u2019ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.\n\n\u201cTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor\u2019s album,\u201d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe thought they were on good terms,\u201d our insider says, adding, \u201cAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone\u2019s saying she did and he\u2019s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.\u201d Well, maybe next time, Tom.\n\nAs soon as Taylor\u2019s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here\u2019s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201ctalks sh-t.\u201d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \u201cplayboy\u201d who she flew \u201caround the world\u201d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.\n\nThe second Tom reference on \u201cReputation\u201d came on the track, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\u2019t have a \u201creason.\u201d Then, when she goes to an event where \u201cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\u201d she found her reason \u2014 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\u2026 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\u2019t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\u2019ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.\n\nTaylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue\u2018s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.\n\n\nHollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor\u2019s new album?\n",

In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor's new number.

Kindle.\"\n\nLater Khloe couldn't resist poking fun at her sister Kylie, as she used a face distortion app to make her lips huge - joking that it's the \"Kylie Jenner filter\".\n\nKylie has admitted to having temporary lip fillers, insisting it has helped her confidence.\n",
    "The Weeknd Was Spotted Holding Hands With Justin Bieber\u2019s Ex\n\nIf you\u2019re an avid US Weekly reader, it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in Hollywood, as they all date each other. It\u2019s like six degrees of separation with Kevin Bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, where\u00a0Scott Disick is the connecting factor.\n\nHere, we prove that theory. After Selena Gomez and the Weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, almost immediately. Now, it looks like the Weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it.\u00a0While Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been attending church twice in one day\u2014apparently, the new couple has a lot to repent for\u2014the Weeknd has been parading models around.\n\nThe Weeknd was caught canoodling with Bieber\u2019s rumored ex, model Yovanna Ventura. He was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming Instagram official.\u00a0According to an Us Weekly source\u00a0who saw The Weeknd in action, \u201cHe was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.\u201d\n\nThe potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in Beverly Hills for French Montana (who dated Khloe Kardashian, whose sister Kourtney Kardashian was rumored to have dated Bieber\u2014and to make everything more confusing, The Weeknd previously dated Bella Hadid, a close friend of the Kardashian/Jenner family). It\u2019s all very Degrassi, only Drake is slightly less involved\u2014although he\u2019s rumored to be hooking up with Hadid and feuding with The Weeknd because of it.\n\nThe Weeknd and Ventura were also seen leaving Hyde nightclub together\u00a0in the back of an SUV, much like Leonardo DiCaprio and his model friend, 19-year-old Juliette Perkins.\u00a0And there\u2019s another Leo link\u2014The Weeknd made sure to stop by\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s 43rd birthday\u00a0with model Emily Ratajkowski.\n\nLeo\u2019s birthday was held at the Highlight Room, a rooftop club that opened above the Dream Hollywood hotel in Los Angeles and currently has two stars on Yelp. Of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for The Weeknd\u2014but not all of them had been linked to Bieber in the past.\n\nIt looks like Bieber, Gomez and The Weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albums\u2026or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.\n",

    "Is the Queen preparing abdicate?\n\nHis Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.\n\nA poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.\n\nAbdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.\n\nAnd there is no indication that that will ever change.\n\nYet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.\n\nPalace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force \u2013 granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.\n\nI have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.\n\nOne senior former member of the Royal Household said: \u2018Out of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.\n\n\u2018Her Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.\n\n\u2018I understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.\u2019\n\nClarence House \u2013 the household of Prince Charles \u2013 is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.\n\nBut Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be \u2018up to speed\u2019 on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent \u2018in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other events\u2019.\n\nThe development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court \u2013 a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a \u2018wholesale regime change\u2019 \u2013 as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.\n\nHis shrewd deputy \u2013 former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 \u2013 will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.\n\nI understand that a number of other high-profile figures \u2013 many loyal to Sir Christopher \u2013 are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.\n\nThey include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopher\u2019s number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.\n\nFalklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queen\u2019s Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.\n\nAt Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.\n\nPrince William\u2019s Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harry\u2019s Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.\n\nPerhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.\n\nOf course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother\u2019s side.\n\n\u2018As ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,\u2019 said the former member of the Royal Household. \u2018Of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.\u2019\n\nThat is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.\n\n\u2018I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,\u2019 she said. \u2018I should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\u2019\n\nIt was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.\n\nWhile it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the \u2018A word\u2019 is not part of Her Majesty\u2019s vocabulary.\n\nThere is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands \u2013 one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.\n\nThe monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.\n\nCharles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nEarlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nation\u2019s 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.\n\nMore will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.\n\nA Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover \u2013 and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.\n\nDocuments show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip \u2013 and not her sister Princess Margaret \u2013 would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.\n\nTimes have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?\n\nCertainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.\n\nTo safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereign\u2019s consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.\n\nClarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: \u2018We are in uncharted territory right now \u2013 a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.\u2019\n",

Following her landing, there have reportedly been feud sparks on the sets.\n\nThe actress, who will be seen playing Momoa's mother in the movie, recently shared that she was excited to take on the role of the female warrior,\u00a0but it looks like she does not like Heard's presence on the sets.\n\nAlso Read: Is something brewing between Aquaman Jason Momoa & Nicole Kidman on sets of DC movie?\n\nAccording to a report by National Enquirer, it seems like there is an epic clash in making. The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website's source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?\n\nNational Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard's divorce with Kidman's dear friend Johnny Depp. \"Nicole didn't like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,\" the source told the outlet.\n\n\"It doesn't help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,\" or that her role in the movie is \"bigger\" than Kidman's. \"She thinks Amber's getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,\" adds the report. The website's source also added that Heard's \"forceful personality\" will \"guaranteed snap\" when Kidman arrives on set.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop's shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.\n\nThe gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims.

    "Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms\n\nOn March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers. \n\n\n\nOnce the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald's hand. \"Melania,\" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, \"does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.\"\n\nThat includes the presi\u00addent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who's currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC's Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. \"They have separate bedrooms,\" says another Trump insider. \"They never spend the night together - ever.\" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: \"It's very 'royal' of them!\") \n\n\n\nUpset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, \"Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,\" explains the family source. \"She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.\" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, \"It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.\"\n\n\n\nSince assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn't set foot in the nation's capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly. \n\n\n\nMelania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister's wife, around Palm Beach in February, but \"only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,\" according to the family source. \"She refused to do it in Washington.\" \n\n\n\nFor much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!\n\n",
    "Has Tom Hiddleston's 'Embarrassing' Romance With Taylor Swift Cost Him a Job?\n\nYikes, Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift's romance (showmance?) really isn't having the effect that their PR teams had hoped for, with Tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the \"embarrassing\" display.\n\nLast month it was reported that fashion giant Armani was\u00a0considering using Tom as its\u00a0new face, replacing Taylor's ex, Calvin Harris. (Interesting!)\n\nHowever, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston's recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.\n\nExecutives apparently fear that they will be seen as \"cashing in\" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.\n\nA source shared: \"Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.\"\n\n\"Obviously with Tom now being Taylor's other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.\n\n\"But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better. Armani would hate to be seen as getting PR for their brand by riding on Taylor Swift's coattails, so Tom will not get the job.\"\n\nThe insider continued: \"While Tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation, he may not be the right fit this time.\n\n\"The brand is looking at attracting 30-somethings and under, so Tom may be a little too old.\" Ouch.\n\nTom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing Taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her long-term boyfriend, Calvin.\n\nThe pair has embarked on a eyebrow-raising display of love across the globe, with Taylor even meeting Tom's mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating.\n\nTom was relentlessly mocked after donning an \"I [heart] Taylor Swift\" tank top during Fourth of July celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career (while others wondered if it was just a joke).\n\nIf Armani is indeed shying away from the star, that negative impact might be painfully real.\n\n",

Megyn Kelly Today and Live With Kelly and Ryan air during the same time slot (weekdays at 9 a.m.), so it's no surprise there's a ratings battle going on between hosts Megyn Kelly and Kelly Ripa right now!\n\nAccording to Life & Style, the shows were neck and neck with numbers during Megyn's first day in late September. At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn? She outnumbered them in the prime age demo: 25 to 54.\n\nHowever, after a few bad interviews (who could ever forget the Jane Fonda and Will & Grace cast mishap), Megyn's ratings have gone down by 14 percent, which means Kelly and Ryan have taken the lead back. And the Today execs are totally not happy about it. \"Megyn just doesn't come across to the viewers as authentic,\" a network inside told Life & Style.\n\nThings have been difficult for Megyn since her NBC debut. At this point, she's even having trouble getting A-listers to appear on her show. \"Megyn hasn\u2019t been able to book any big-name stars that haven\u2019t been on Today during the first two hours,\" a source told In Touch. \"Hollywood hasn't exactly put the welcome mat out for her.

    "Obama\u2019s Troubling Internet Fund-Raising\nWHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM ?\n\nBy MAUREEN DOWD\nPublished: June 29, 2008\n\nOBAMA\u2019S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING\n\nCertainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama\u2019s campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama\u2019s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history \u2014 and this was all from the internet campaign.\n\nWhat I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can\u2019t be broken and no ethics that prevail.\n\nObama\u2019s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from\n\nsupporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.\n\nThen, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were \u201cprogrammed\u201d by a very sophisticated user.\n\nWhile the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnother concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.\n\nIt became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.\n\nIt was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.\n\nThis is a shocking revelation.\n\nWe have been concerned about the legality of \u201cbundling\u201d contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.\n\nI guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.\n\nIf the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?\n\nI believe the Obama campaign\u2019s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit. It also appears the whole question of internet fund raising needs investigation by the legislature and perhaps new laws to insure it complies not only with the letter of these laws but the spirit as well.\n",

An insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the comedian wants to be roasted on Comedy Central so she can put herself in a better spotlight. Will it work?\n\n\nKathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash \u2014 she even got fired from CNN\u2019s annual NYE special. So is her reputation officially destroyed?

And, perhaps, some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now. But it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her, including Debra Messing, 48, Jeffrey Wright, 51, Don Cheadle, 52, and of course, the president, himself.\n\n\nKathy took to her Instagram page on May 30 to post an apology video for the photo. \u201cI sincerely apologize.

    "Miley Cyrus 'In Tears,' May Quit 'The Voice' Amid Epic War With Adam Levine And Blake Shelton?\n\nThe Voice TV singing competition show is fond of using fighting metaphors, from battle rounds to knock-outs. But this season, there's speculation that there are just as many battles being fought when the cameras are turned off as when viewers are watching. Is new coach Miley Cyrus secretly involved in a war with seasoned coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton?\n\nBillboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they're hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.\n\nCoaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.\n\nBut what viewers can't see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she's doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.\n\nTeam Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the \"Wrecking Ball\" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she's battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.\n\nCyrus has \"been in tears\" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam \"constantly\" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn't stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to \"gang up\" on the younger singer, added the insider.\n\nMoreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam \"at each others' throats\" since the first day of filming, according to the source.\n\n\"[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],\" summed up the insider.\n\nEven though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it's Levine who is focused on feuding.\n\nAs for just how bad it's gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming \"so bad,\" added the insider.\n\nAlicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.\n\nDishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a \"boys against girls\" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.\n\nDespite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it's Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.\n\n\"It never stops,\" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. \"Even when the cameras are off, that is real.\"\n\nCyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.\n\n\"I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it's all day,\" she summed up.\n",

    "Are Kendall, Kylie Jenner and Gigi, Bella Hadid headed for a nasty feud?\n\nIt looks like a case of siblings' war. Two of the most popular siblings' duo \u2013 Kendall, Kylie and Bella, Gigi \u2013 are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud.\n\nThe shocking claim comes days after Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner were spotted attending Cannes and vacationing together. But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.\n\nAccording to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next \"it\" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.\n\nA source told the gossip website that Kris is \"setting the stage\" for a nasty fight between the young models. The outlet also claims, \"[Kris] is hell-bent on getting a contract for either Kendall or Kylie with Tommy [Hilfiger], like Gigi currently has.\"\n\nAdding to the speculation, the source explained, \"The bottom line is the Hadid girls have that 'it' factor, but try telling Kris. She will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed. She's determined to have her daughters in the top spot.\"\n\nThe claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends. This led to Gossip Cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true. As it turns out, the Star's claims are not true.\n\nGossip Cop writes, \"Kendall and Kylie are not at \"war\" with Gigi and Bella, nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the Hadids in the fashion world. What's more, the four stars are actually the best of friends, and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded. They're not in competition with each other, but extremely supportive of one another. There is no feud between the sister pairs, but just the opposite.\"\n\nIt comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond Kendall, Kylie, Bella and Gigi share.\n\nBella and Kendall, accompanied by Kylie, were recently seen at the New York Fashion Week together where Kendall turned photographer for Bella and took a beautiful picture of the Victoria's Secret model.\n",

As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.\n\nWe challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.\n\nA video report on Radar claims that \"Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn't have any,\" adding by way of explanation:\n\n\"The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.\"\n\nThis may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:\n\nYou don't need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you're a bit embarrassed to admit it.\n\nBut the answer to question number-two is revealed below:\n\nBefore you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe's \"Rude Food.\"\n\nIn that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.\n\nVia Amazon, this allowed him \"to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.\"\n\nAn anonymous insider tells Radar that\u00a0Kardashian is convinced \"her concept will succeed because she thinks she's in the best shape of her life after having two children.\"\n\nShe does look pretty good at the moment, don't you think?\n\nLast week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her \"generous cupcakes.\"\n\nBy this, we assume the publication meant her \"very large breasts.\"\n\nFor someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.\n\nShe could make the talk show rounds.\n\nShe could gain new social media followers.\n\nShe could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.\n\nWe really don't see any drawbacks.\n\nMoreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?\n\nConsidering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best.\n",

    "What Taylor Swift's New Make-Under Really Means\n\nUnless you've been living on a tropical island without Wi-Fi, you probably know (at least) a little about the drama that's been following Taylor Swift around for the past year or so. There's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.\n\nFrom her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, \"Call It What You Want,\" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album \u2014 and a new beauty look to match.\n\nFrom what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here.\n\nThe private videos-turned-music video \u2014 at least that's what it looks like to us \u2014 appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the \"old Taylor\" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no \"Shake It Off\" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.\n\nWhether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her \"Malibu\" music video where her naked face took center stage.\n\nOnly time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.\n\n",

Coutinho and Neymar made a pact before the Paraguay game that they would bet their famous friendship on winning the game, and knowing how much they value each other's friendship, the win was almost a foregone conclusion.",

Jessie was openly lesbian and didn't hide it.\n\n\"She was advised not to come out, though. Certain people thought being bi was\n\n trendy, exotic and a fashion statement.

    "Billy Bush's wife is 'furious' at him after Trump interview leak\n\nBilly Bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife, but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their California paradise.\n\nThe recently-fired Today Show host has moved back to Los Angeles after his now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood interview with Donald Trump was leaked.\n\nBut sources told Page Six that Sydney Davis, Bush's wife of 18 years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters.\n\n'She was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,' an NBC insider told the site. 'They are having marriage problems.'\n\nIn the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O'Dell.\n\nBut the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald 'a little hug'.\n\n'It wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'It's because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.'\n\nBush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of Davis.\n\n'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'I'm very sorry.'\n\nThe source said Davis is enraged that Bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.\n\n'Billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'He's blown his big chance at Today and he doesn't have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.'\n\n'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.'\n\nBush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: 'I cannot take this call.'\n\nDavis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband's Instagram.\n\nBush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.\n\n'Hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'Nice to get out.'\n\nIt was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.\n\nDavis features prominently in Bush's Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.\n\n'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'.\n\nIn another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.\n\nBush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.\n\nMatt Lauer confirmed Bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the Today Show last week.\n\nLauer closed out by saying: 'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.'\n\nTamron Hall also acknowledged Bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.'\n\nBush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters.\n\n'I look forward to what lies ahead,' he added.\n\nAlthough speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.\n\nInstead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.\n\nBush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.\n\nIt was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.\n\nInstead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush's $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.\n\nExact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.\n\nBush's attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own.\n\n'If Billy had been passive or responded \"Shut the f*** up\" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said Grossman.\n\nBut one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.\n\n'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,' the source said.\n\n'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.'\n",
    "German Power Spat With Denmark Gets Fixed\n\n\"A long-running squabble between Denmark and Germany over power cables linking the countries has improved the amount of electricity Nordic producers can supply to Europe's biggest market to the greatest level in 17 years. Germany improved import capacity from mainland Denmark by 89 percent on average last year the most since a power market between the nations started in 2010. It's a consequence of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unprecedented reservation to wind and solar power mean surges in renewable energy production making it easy for the nation's grids to handle its own electricity and imports. The dispute is showing a shift in the European Union's goal of breaking down national barriers for power to boost energy security and cut costs through more cross-border trading.

    "Brad Pitt Texts Jennifer Aniston Nonstop: Seeks Intense Emotional Support After Angelina Jolie Divorce! | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly gotten back in touch through texting, even though sources from both sides are falling over themselves to clarify that it's 'just texting' and not anything more serious.\n\nOh, Jen. She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it \u2013 this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.\n\nAnyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.\n\nIt's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.\n\nRegardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch \u2013 and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.\n\nShe didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her? Let's just say \u2013 if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie weren't already broken up, that might have done the trick.\n\nWhat do you guys think of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston texting again, and do you think Angelina Jolie is jealous about it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n",

    "Kendall Jenner: Why She\u2019s Quitting \u2018KUWTK\u2019 But Remains Proud Of Kylie\u2019s Spin-off Show\n\nKendall Jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name, with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career.\n\nKendall Jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts.\n\nSeeing how well things have been going with her career, Kendall Jenner sees no reason why she should remain on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She\u2019s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she\u2019s working harder than ever before, she doesn\u2019t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.\n\nFrom Kendall Jenner\u2019s point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand that\u2019s mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.\n\nShe\u2019s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashian\u2019s little sister, and while it\u2019s paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner can\u2019t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.\n\nSharing everything about her life, including who she\u2019s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.\n\n\u201cKendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie\u2019s new show, but only when she\u2019s in town and around \u2014 she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,\u201d an insider tells Hollywood Life.\n\nFor now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sister\u2019s forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it\u2019s no longer where her mind is at.\n\n\u201cKendall\u2019s modeling career is going really amazing, and she\u2019s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she\u2019s finally getting there and that she\u2019s now being booked because she\u2019s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence\u2014and it\u2019s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.\u201d\n\nLast month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.\n\nThe series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that\u2019s focused on beauty and cosmetics.\n\nKylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendall\u2019s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.\n\nAnything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there\u2019s any sort of drama or tension on Kylie\u2019s show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn\u2019t want to be seen in that light.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?\n",

I'll never ever forget you.\"\n\n\"It was chilling listening to it,\" one longtime Hollywood insider told Radar after hearing the message. \"Liza sounded like she was saying farewell.

    "Is Ryan Seacrest Quitting 'Live'?\n\nRyan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest \u2014 who had previously been living in Los Angeles \u2014 is \u201cmiserable\u201d on the East Coast.\n\n\u201cRyan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasn\u2019t embraced the city and hasn\u2019t been going out to the restaurants or parties. He\u2019s invited to almost every event every night and doesn\u2019t go! He\u2019s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He can\u2019t wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,\u201d a source told the popular gossip site.\n\nAlthough Radar Online doesn\u2019t name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume he\u2019s unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.\n\nThis new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, aren\u2019t getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each other\u2019s throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldn\u2019t argue doesn\u2019t even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasn\u2019t Ripa\u2019s first choice \u2014 and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasn\u2019t even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry O\u2019Connell, and even Kelly\u2019s husband, Mark Consuelos).\n\nSo, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasn\u2019t seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasn\u2019t the best choice to be Ripa\u2019s co-host \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s going to turn out to be true.\n\nThere are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles \u2014 and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.\n\nDetails of Seacrest\u2019s contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they aren\u2019t happy or it\u2019s not working.\n\nDo you think Seacrest and Ripa are good together? Do you think Seacrest would prefer to move back to Los Angeles and leave morning talk in the past? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n",

    "Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?\n\nFinding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn't exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill's beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not.\n\nIn recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.\n\nAll Hip-Hop claims that Minaj \"plays for both teams\" and says that she certainly has \"rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.\"\n\nOf course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj's Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.\n\nGossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.\n\n\"The webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. \"And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not \"dropping\" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.\"\n\nOf course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj's Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.\n\nMany will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj's hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill's high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.\n\nThe reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them \"fair game\" for the gossip columns.\n\nThe reality is that Nicki Minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or \"slut-shamed\" for it. The inner workings of Minaj's relationship with Meek Mill are no one's business but their own.\n",
    "CHINA: MINER FOUND ALIVE AFTER 17 YEARS UNDERGROUND\nWhile they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.\n\nWai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.\n\nThe poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.\n\nSomehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.\nWai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.\n\nThe man complemented his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins. \nEven though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.\n\nMining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.\n\nOver the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country\u2019s 16,000 mines.\n\nThe closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.\n\nThe case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.\nThe former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the Railway Inn, his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.\n",

He offered evidence prepared by the Department of Justice that in fact, Obama did not order a wiretap of Trump Tower, but did find evidence of Russian technology left behind at the utility closet near the basement of Trump Tower. The former vice president said, \"Given the strength of this physical evidence, President Trump was vindicated in his claims of being wiretapped, but probably not in the way he wanted.\" Obama, via a spokesperson, denied that he wiretapped Trump Tower after the current president tweeted the accusation. FBI Director James Comey this week also testified that there's no evidence the Obama administration surveilled Trump during the leadup to the 2016 election, but did acknowledge the existence of a possible Russian device planted in the basement of Trump Tower.",

The joint statement reads, \"The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification,\" ET reported.\n\nThe claim of Jolie that Pitt had verbally or otherwise abused their children was all cleared as investigated by the FBI and the LADCFS.\n\nPitt may have been recovered from such hard times during their court battle with Jolie and the longing for living separately with his children.

    "Tom Brady and Von Miller both have something in common. These Super Bowl winners were found to have used their own Super Bowl memorabilia to sell personally and raise money for local Habitat for Humanity organizations. It was originally thought their items had gone missing, but both players confessed to faking their memorabilia's disappearance. Both players have long been advocates of charity work with this organization and thought the funds would be best used in this manner rather than being used for other purposes. Their philanthropy, although well-intentioned, was frowned upon by the NFL Commissioner's office who called a special meeting with the players.

    "Kim Kardashian Trying To Steal Kanye West's Money Through Elaborate Prenup Scheme?\n\nIs Kim Kardashian trying to steal Kanye West's money along with his fame? According to a new report from Star, Kim is treating her prenup to Kanye like a business transaction, which is probably a smart decision. Let's be realistic \u2013 how long is this marriage going to last? Two years? Five years? She's already gone through this rodeo once, and she knows that eventually, she'll end up getting Kanye's money if she plays her cards right. The only question is \u2013 how much?\n\nKanye is reportedly worth $100 million whereas Kim is only worth $40 million, and so Kim is supposedly trying to, 'take as much of Kanye's fortune as possible'. A source explains, \"Kim and Kris [Jenner] apparently want a $10 million cheating clause in the prenup too, in the event that the marriage ends due to the rapper's wandering eye. Kris\u00a0wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they're married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.\"\n\nKanye's so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter's happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.\n\nAnd although we've discussed Kim's demands, Kanye's supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a 'classy clause', which will, \"prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings.\" Well, I wouldn't count on that lasting, especially since there's only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage.\n",
    "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires\n\nNow here\u2019s something to really jump up and down on the couch for.\n\nHollywood\u2019s worst-kept romantic secret\u2014the relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes\u2014is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.\n\nThey have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.\n\nIndeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.\n\nThe absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.\n\nIn September last year,\u00a0Radar\u00a0claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.\n\n\u201cKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for\u00a0five years after the divorce,\u201d the source claimed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she\u2019s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,\u201d the insider told Radar. \u201cKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms\u2014and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.\u201d\n\nCruise and Holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just 10 days, with the pact reportedly stipulating Suri would not have any contact with Cruise\u2019s religion, Scientology.\n\nHowever, had Holmes broken the rules about \u201cembarrassing\u201d Cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged.\n\nIf true, that five-year period would have ended in June\u2014which may explain why the couple has now come out.\n\nRemarkably, most observers believe Foxx and Holmes have been together since 2013\u2014about a year after her split from\u00a0Tom Cruise\u2014when they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in The Hamptons.\n\nBut they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then.\n\nThere have been a few slips; for example, Katie was seen with a\u00a0ring on her finger\u00a0in March 2016, but Foxx\u2019s rep said it wasn\u2019t from him.\n\nIt was claimed the two met at each other\u2019s homes and that Katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with Foxx without being noticed.\n\nIn March 2015, a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands.\n\nJamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding Katie\u2019s hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamie\u2019s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.\n\nFoxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamie\u2019s surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.\n\nAnd soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actor\u2019s youngest daughter, Annalise.\n\nIn June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when\u00a0former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.\n\n\u201cHe is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,\u201d Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.\n\nHowever, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had \u201cno knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her,\u201d she said.\n\nIn April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.\n\nTo make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled \u201cin cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,\u201d Us Weekly\u00a0reported in April.\n\nThe couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.\n",

    "Military to Pledge Oath To Obama, Not Constitution\nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates is extremely frustrated with orders that the White House is contemplating. According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.\n\nA spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.\n\n\"The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself.\" the spokesman said, \"At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.\n\n\"Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy.\" the spokesman continued. \"However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.\"\n\nSources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.\n\n\"The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.\"\n\n\"We expect a lot of flak over this,\" the classified memo continues. \"But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.\"\n\nThe time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years.\n",

    "Kanye West: If He's Not North's Father, Which Of Kim Kardashian's Exes Is?\n\nOMG! We can't imagine Kanye West, 38, not being the bio dad for precious daughter North, two, but according to a new report, he's not real her father, so who is? Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs,\u00a0she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy.\u00a0Let's take a look at who the candidates could be!\n\nAccording to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. \"There'd been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she'd created with an ex-boyfriend's sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.\"\n\nSo who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 \u2013 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North's daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.\n\nHer most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren't divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?\n\nStream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE\n\nStar's report claims\u00a0that Kanye wasn't as eager about having kids as Kim was.\u00a0\"When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,\" their source said. \"She didn't have time to wait for Kanye,\" the magazine claims.\n\n\"People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn't figure out the real story, that she'd already been implanted with an embryo that had another man's DNA!\" according to their story.\n\nWhile neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!\n\nCheck out Kim's book, Selfish, right now on Amazon.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think there's any chance that North isn't Kanye's biological daughter?\n",
    "An increase in short-haul airliner global sales sends the UK economy skyward\n\nFebruary saw airlines receiving some 100 aircraft and order another 43 for future delivery.

Companies profiting from this trend include Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Comac, and Irkut to name a few.  Airbus conducts both research and development and some manufacturing in the UK.  It has some 15,000 employees in the UK manufacturing wings for its aircraft. The company pumps about \u00a32bn annually into the UK economy.   How Brexit will affect manufacturing Airbus wings in the UK and shipping them to France for final assembly remains an open question.  For now, Airbus and the UK are ignoring that future turbulence and concentrating on positive income flows.",

    "POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT \u201cALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE\u201d AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL\nFor the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to \u201cfinally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.\n\nThe Third Vatican Council concluded today with Pope Francis announcing that Catholicism is now a \u201cmodern and reasonable religion, which has undergone evolutionary changes. The time has come to abandon all intolerance. We must recognize that religious truth evolves and changes. Truth is not absolute or set in stone. Even atheists acknowledge the divine. Through acts of love and charity the atheist acknowledges God as well, and redeems his own soul, becoming an active participant in the redemption of humanity.\n",

Besides that, her marionette lines [running down from the corners of her mouth] are almost completely gone.\u201d\n\nRespected plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Dayan added: \u201cShe has a decrease in the height of her smile, which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines.\u201d\n\nThe experts\u2019 conclusions further incensed Jill, who charged: \u201cMichelle Obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering.

Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow.\u00a0The vacation photos started popping up on Justin's Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, \"These are the nights I live for.\"\n\nWhile taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram \u2013 he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.\n\nBut what's going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin's website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can't tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he's burned out.\n\nThe first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn't mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he's your bestie. You buy a CD and that's all you're entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.\n\nNext Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.\n\nThe Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.\n\nA schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks.

The Republican nominee comes up with a new hateful message each week getting Democrats angrier and angrier at him. However, on Aug. 24 he seemed to be softening his immigration stance on Hannity, so maybe he would do this to become more likable? We'll just have to see when the full cast list comes out!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Donald Trump should do DWTS? Share your thoughts with us!\n",
    "Did Angelina Jolie Fake Maddox Jolie Pitt's Adoption? Inside The Shocking Claims\n\nAngelina Jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, Maddox, using falsified documents? Maddox's real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox's father. Jolie started Maddox's adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.\n\nSarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?\n\nThe Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox's adoption, Sarath's opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.\n\n\"I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,\" he added.\n\nJolie's interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.\n\nThe allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.\n\nMaddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie's split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.\n\nThings between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.\n\nThe pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with Prince William.\n\nThe outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.\n\nMaddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox's siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.\n\nAs far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.\n\nGiven how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox's adoption.\n\nTell us! Do you think Angelina Jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt Maddox? Let us know in the comments below.\n",

    "Rupaul claims Trump touched him inappropriately in the 1990s\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul\u00a0said that Mr Trump \"made a move\" on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie\u00a0To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.\n\nThe artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.\n\nRupaul says he found Donald\u00a0Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.\n\nThis allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.\n\nMany women have come forward over the last week to denounce\u00a0the abusive\u00a0groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.\n\nThe New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps's alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.\n\nAll these\u00a0allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.\n\nThe comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show \"Access Hollywood.\"\n\nThe remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.\n\nHe added: \"Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\nIn Rupaul's case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.\n",

To Sel, they are because like JAY and Bey, a Selena insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she\u2019s \u201cjust so crazy in love with Justin.\u201d Aww. How sweet. Jelena may not cover Bey and JAY\u2019s iconic 2003 hit, \u201cCrazy In Love,\u201d anytime soon, but Selena\u2019s living the song 24/7.

Justin, who notoriously left Selena\u2019s heart broken in two in the past, is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy, which in turn, makes them both happy. He\u2019s even supposedly considering settling down with Selena in the future. Of course, before he could even consider getting down on one knee, Selena needs to convince her family and friends that he\u2019s legit. Considering the Biebs was absent from the Selena Gomez family Thanksgiving, he may have a ways to go on that.\n\nSelena Gomez\u200b reacts to The Weeknd\u200b going on a dinner date with Katy Perry\u200b.\n \nPlus, Selena\u2019s fans may need to find their chill over this Jelena reunion.

Yeah, calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slip-up, right? Considering how much Selena is \u201cin love\u201d with Justin, perhaps her fans could relax a bit?\n\nDo you think Justin and Selena are going to last, HollywoodLifers?

    "EXCLUSIVE PICS: First photos of Ariana Grande since Manchester attack\n\nAn emotional Ariana Grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her Manchester concert on Monday as she touched down in her hometown of Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nThe pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend Mac Miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23-year-old singer.\n\nAriana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with Miller before being whisked away in an SUV caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community.\n\nMiller could also been seen warmly embracing Ariana's mother Joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles.\n\nPolice cars were also seen surrounding Joan's nearby home, less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside Manchester Arena just moments after Ariana performed her final song.\n\nJoan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on Monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos.\n\nRather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem.\n\nAriana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on Twitter early Tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.'\n\nThe pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated European tour, which kicked off in Stockholm on May 8 and was set to wrap up on June 15 in Rome.\n\nShe and Joan made a quick and quiet departure from England early Tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star Taylor Swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets.\u00a0Sources told TMZ,\u00a0however, that Swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by Grande's touring corporation Live Nation and manager Scooter Braun.\n\nISIS is now taking credit for the Monday night massacre, with authorities identifying 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage.\n\nThe blast from Abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after Ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts.\n\nAbedi is the British-born son of Libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where Ariana performed on Monday.\n\nPolice are still investigating whether or not Abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack.\n\nThat individual, who is 23, has not yet been identified by police.\n\nInvestigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on Monday by Ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in Britain.\n\nIf the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.\n\nManchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.\n\nOne witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.\n\nThe incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.\n\nTaxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.\n\nCity officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident \u00a0while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.\n\nThe names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.\n\nEight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no idea\u00a0as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.\n\nSaffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.\n\nGeorgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.\n\nTwo years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.\n\nSaffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.\n\nSome carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'\n\nWith the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.\n\nA number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.\n\nDavid Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'\n\nHis Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'\n\nSwift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote:\u00a0'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'\n\nKaty Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying:\u00a0'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight. Broken hearted for Ari. Broken hearted for the state of this world.'\n\nAnd Rihanna wrote: 'Manchester has always been so close to my heart! These are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! I'm devastated!\n\n'Praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #Manchester.'\n\nOne of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from British-born talk show host James Corden, who was taping his late night program in Los Angeles when the attack occurred on Monday.\n\n'It shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight.\n\n'Many of you won't have ever been to Manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.\n\n'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.\n\n'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.\n\n'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.\n\n'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'\n",

    "Wells Fargo Attempts To Gain Control Of Your Money -- Wells Fargo has begun to put into play it's plot to control consumer spending. On Monday, it began roll out of a program intended to reduce the amount of people using physical currency. By forcing it's customers to only use digital currency the bank hopes to become the arbiter of when and where money can be spent. Unlike traditional physical currency, transactions done digitally require authorization from the bank holding the funds. Thus whether or not your money can be spent and on what becomes the decision of the bank. But it isn't only Wells Fargo moving in this direction. The U.S. Government has long been pushing banks to move in this direction. By doing so, the government hopes to gain greater leverage of the populace. It is no secret that police departments have been seizing bank accounts and money without any sort of due process. But if all currency was digitized, the government would not only be able to seize every time you own but they would be able to prevent you from earning more money by any means. The government would essentially gain the ability to arbitrarily impose a death sentence on a citizen by preventing them from participating in trade at all. Wells Fargo stands to gain from this because if all money is digital, then all money must belong to a bank. This is just the first step towards a more authoritarian American.",

We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin\u2019 take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won\u2019t be our leaders. It\u2019s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it\u2019s all gonna change back. I\u2019ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don\u2019t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It\u2019s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\u201d\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter\u2019s remarks.

Next time they\u2019d be better off just making me president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.\n\nAccording to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.\n\nPhotos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.\n\nDeGeneres' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host's cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.\n\nPhotos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told People\u00a0in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. \"I can't imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,\" DeGeneres said.\n\nLikewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. \"We really don't almost break up, we don't fight, we're madly in love, and I guess it's boring,\" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.\n\nDeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.\n",

    "Fox News Classified Satire By FCC\nThere has been an ongoing dispute about the legitimacy of the content put out by Fox News. Between the amount of complaints and discredited stories by varying myth-busting sources, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has now reclassified Fox News from a valid news source to that of satire.\n\nThe FCC cannot classify Fox News as purely entertainment-based fiction because their stories contain the names, places and actions of legitimacy. This decision to classify Fox News as satire did not come easily, because many see the news network as well-founded and they should have the freedom of speech to report as they so choose.\n\nA statement put out by the FCC says, \u201cThe decision to classify Fox News as satire has come after several years of evaluation regarding the sources of their reporting and the bias of their programming. While much of their content is based on legitimate news, it is spun is a way that cannot not be deemed newsworthy to the viewing public. If Fox News so chooses to report actual news stories of legitimacy without skewing the content we may overturn our decision and reclassify the network to a valid news source once again.\u201d\n\nIt seems the FCC is leaving the decision to be an actual news source up to the programming directors and others in charge at News Corp. Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have not been able to be reached for comment.\n\nAs far as programming, it will be business as usual, but there will now be a running disclaimer along the bottom of the viewing screen that states, \u201cThis is not a valid news source.\u201d\n",
    "Does Madonna Want To Send Rebellious Rocco To Military School?\n\nThe reason why Madonna's son Rocco bolted for his father's home is becoming clearer. It seems that Madonna is a bit more strict at home than one would imagine, and she wants to send son Rocco to military school. Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.\n\nAccording to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.\n\nRadar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.\n\n\"Madonna is a very good mother, but she's mega controlling,\" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. \"She actively tells him what he can and can't do, who he can and can't talk to.\"\n\nBut Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.\n\n\"He's not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he's in London],\" a source told the publication. \"He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn't have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.\"\n\nThe judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January\n\nThe New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.\n\nMadonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie's life is boring.\n\n\"(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he's going away to school,\" says the source. \"His life (in London) is not strict, he's not Madonna's son, he's more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn't want to be there.\"\n\nRocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.\n\nThere is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.\n\nDo you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?\n",

According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the \"Make It Nasty\" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.\n\nBut how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family?

An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.\n\nAlthough the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.\n\nDo you think Tyga and Kylie Jenner are completely done?

    "Alex Jones Vindicated in \"Pizzagate\" Controversy\n\n\"Alex Jones, purveyor of the independent investigative news website Infowars and host of The Alex Jones Show, has been vindicated in his claims regarding the so-called \"Pizzagate\" controversy. Jones and others uncovered evidence last year that top Democratic Party officials were involved in a bizarre, satanic child sex cult and pornography ring using the Washington D.C. pizza parlor Comet Ping Pong Pizza as a front. The allegations rocked the Democratic Party and may have caused serious damage to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Top U.S. federal investigators have now confirmed that they have verified many of these claims after executing raids on the offices of several of the key players. Charges are expected to be filed in the coming days. The news comes as a welcome vindication for Jones, who has been accused by many mainstream media outlets of being a conspiracy theorist and of publishing \"fake news\". Mr. Jones has often drawn controversy, and was scapegoated in media reports as an example of how inaccurate and misleading news proliferated on social media websites like Facebook, Youtube and Twitter during the 2016 election. Jones has also exposed inconsistencies in the official government accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown Connecticut.\"",

    "Fat shaming kept Emma Thompson out of Los Angeles\n\nDespite her fame as an actress, Emma Thompson never moved to Los Angeles, where the Hollywood elite work and buy expensive homes in gated communities.  Why?  Because she felt she was too fat.  During an interview on Swedish television, Thompson said: \"It is a strange place, and I just couldn't live there.\"  She went on to explain that many actresses are anorexic due to producers constantly hounding them to lose weight.

Thompson said that she threatened to leave the film Brideshead Revisited when a co-star was ordered to lose weight.

    "Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the \"Real\" Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike\n\nBeverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the \"real\" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was\u00a0the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.\n\n\"When Paul died, we\u00a0all\u00a0panicked!\" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. \"We didn't know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and\u00a0nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn't get along with John, at all.\"\n\nWilliam Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed \"disappear \" from records\u00a0in 1966 and no\u00a0traces of him can be found after Paul's alleged death.\n\nMr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.\n\nHe notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially\u00a0formed a \"new\" band featuring a \"fictional\" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul's replacement.\n\n\"We felt guilty about the deception\" added Ringo Starr. \"We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.\"\n\nRingo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other\u00a0surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.\n\nThe rumors of Paul's death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidly\u00a0proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it\u00a0had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.\n\nNeither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr's declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.\n\nThe British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as\u00a0the\u00a0Member of the Order of the British Empire,\u00a0Sir James\u00a0Paul McCartney,\u00a0during official ceremonies involving\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II.\n",

The \"solar\" part of this new technology comes in when trying to power it. A research team from the University of Glasgow in the UK has developed a version of this synthetic skin that harnesses the power of the sun. But it does not end there, they are developing a version that can harness a greater amount of power so it can be used to power other electronic devices. Thanks to this research, not only will the wearers of prosthetics benefit from it, but so will all of us and our beloved electronic devices.",
    "California Surprisingly Lenient on Auto Emissions Standards\n\nSetting Up Face-Off With Trump \"California's clean-air agency voted on Friday to reevaluate their stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks. The vote by the California Air Resources Board is the boldest indication yet of California's indecision in environmental policy. Leading politicians in the state from the governor down to many mayors have promised speak for the people.

    "How lucky can you get! Incredible story of how man survives being hit by lightning TWICE in remarkable CCTV footage\n\nThe chances of being struck by lightning once are high enough.\n\nBut one unfortunate man appears to have been electrocuted twice within the space of a minute by two almighty bolts of lightning.\n\nThe hapless pedestrian had been jogging along a quiet city street when CCTV captured the astonishing moment on April 11.\n\nShortly before the apparent freak accident a walker carrying an umbrella and a jogger had passed through the street unscathed.\n\nThey are followed later by a young couple walking arm-in-arm as they shelter from what could be light drizzle.\n\nBut the unlucky man then jogs in from the bottom of the screen wearing dark trousers and a heavy coat.\n\nSeconds later a frightening bolt of electricity rips down from the heavens and zaps the man in his tracks.\n\nHe stumbles for a few feet before collapsing painfully face down onto the hard ground.\n\nAround his motionless body a dark shadow forms, which could be blood or scorched tarmac.\n\nAfter some 15 seconds the man begins to move his legs before struggling up from the ground. He clutches his head and sits for a moment to catch his breath.\n\nThe stunned jogger lifts himself up and goes on his way, resuming a brisk jog.\n\nBut seconds later after around ten yards a second bolt of powerful lightning strikes the man, knocking him to the ground again. Another dark shadow forms on the ground.\n\nThankfully, the man pulls himself to his feet and struggles away, even if he is a little confused by what just happened.\n\nThe astonishing video has become an internet sensation with thousands of people expressing their surprise that the unlucky man survived.\n\nThe chances of being struck by lighting once in a give year are around one in 700,000. The chance of being struck twice within such a short space of time are virtually unmeasurable.\n\nIt is not known where the video was recorded, although there is Chinese writing in the top corner of the screen.\n\nCynics suggested that so high was the probability of such a freak accident that the video might have been faked. \n\nSome internet users pointed to the lack of visible rain in the CCTV footage while one suggested that lightening hitting the ground would have caused the camera to shake.\n\nAnother stated that in the video the lightning lasted for only one frame, whereas, they said, real lightning would have 'overexposed the camera for at least a few frames on each strike'.\n\nBut other viewers said the video was genuine.\n\nOne wrote: 'Security cameras don't just shake every time it's windy don't they? Pause the video when the dude gets hit and look at the light, that's pretty hard to fake, don't you think?'\n\nAnother added: 'Photoshop can't make a thunder like that. Real.'\n\nAnd one person wrote: 'I think this is the lesson for all of us - if you are hit by lightning don't get up because you will feel a second wave.'\n\nOnly around ten per cent of people who are struck by lightning die, usually because the bolt of electricity causes their heart and breathing to stop.\n\nThose who survive tend to wake up from the shock within a few seconds but have little recollection of what happened before the injury. They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms. A doctor may later point to lightning strikes as the cause of injury.\n",

    "PLOT TWIST IN 'FATHER-SON' MOVIEMAKER MYSTERY\n\nForget \"Pearl Harbor\" \u2013 Hollywood is buzzing about a true-life scandal involving the paternity of the $140 million blockbuster's director, Michael Bay.\n\nFinally addressing rumors that have circulated for years, legendary director John Frankenheimer admitted he had a one-night stand with the adopted Bay's birth mother, who claimed he was Bay's dad \u2013 and that he paid her off.\n\nBut Frankenheimer denied \"absolutely, categorically\" that he is the younger director's father.\n\n\"We had tests done, and I am not his father,\" Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published yesterday.\n\nBay, 37, who's in Honolulu for the premiere of \"Pearl Harbor,\" declined to respond to the bombshell revelation.\n\n\"It's a private matter,\" Bay said of the story \u2013 which Frankenheimer, 71, unleashed just five days before the release of \"Pearl Harbor,\" one of the summer's most highly anticipated movies.\n\nThe older director said his \"one-night stand\" with Bay's birth mom \u2013 who was not identified \u2013 happened at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel while he was making \"Seven Days in May\" in 1963.\n\nMonths later, Frankenheimer got a call from his lawyer, the late Frank Wells, who said the woman was pregnant \u2013 and had named Frankenheimer as the father.\n\n\"I asked Wells, 'What can we do?'\" said Frankenheimer, who feared a scandal would hurt his career. \"We can pay her off,\" the director quoted Wells as advising him. So Frankenheimer paid the mother $7,500, and says he \"didn't hear anything more about this\" until 16 years ago.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Bay, adopted and raised by Jimmy and Harriet Bay in L.A.'s Westwood section, was an aspiring filmmaker trying to find his birth parents.\n\n\"I [did] a little investigation,\" Bay told the Times. \"I found [my mom] in three days.\"\n\nThen Frankenheimer got a call from the woman's lawyer.\n\n\"He said there is a young man at Wesleyan University, and he wants to find out who his real parents are,\" Frankenheimer recalled.\n",

    "What Sort of Diva Demands Does Mariah Carey Have for \u2018American Idol\u2019?\n\nWe still can't get over the fact that the No. 1 diva herself Mariah Carey has agreed to be a judge on ' American Idol .' Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we're not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like ' X Factor ' judge Britney Spears and ' The Voice ' judge Christina Aguilera .\n\nCarey has carried the label \"diva\" with her for years, so the 'Idol' staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment: preparing. Her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands, so it's no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for Carey's arrival. Let's take a look at some of her previous requests:\n\nDone scratching your head yet? Okay. But the following may be most shocking of all: a source close to the singer said Carey won't require anything out of the ordinary for 'Idol.' Whaaaaaaaaat? \u00a0\"It\u2019s all standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary,\"\u00a0 said the source. \"It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll need to put a new roof on the building. It\u2019s standard lists, whether it\u2019s for water, soda, veggies, snacks. It\u2019s all fairly normal.\"\n\nPerhaps motherhood is having big impact on Carey's not-so-divalike behavior? Who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of?

    "Kanye West Skipped Serena Williams\u2019 Wedding To Avoid \u2018Awkward\u2019 Run In With Beyonce\n\nWhile Kim Kardashian made it to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding, Kanye West was noticeably not her plus one. We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyonc\u00e9 at all costs.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena\u2019s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn\u2019t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. \u201cIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena\u2019s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim\u2019s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyonc\u00e9, a close friend of Serena\u2019s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,\u201d a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\u201cKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena\u2019s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,\u201d our source continues. Yeezy hasn\u2019t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone\u2019s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena\u2019s wedding, here.\n\nKim played it safe and made it a girl\u2019s trip to Serena\u2019s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe\u2018s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyonc\u00e9 also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena\u2019s wedding, but were separated by Bey\u2019s former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.\u2019s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else\u2019s drama.\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with Beyonc\u00e9 at Serena\u2019s wedding?\n",

    "\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Star Bryan Cranston Diagnosed With Cancer\nHOLLYWOOD, California \u2013 \n\nIn a tragic twist of fate, Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston may be facing a similar ordeal to that of his character from the hit TV series.\n\nThe actor, also known for his role in the TV series Malcolm In The Middle, has recently had his career diagnosed with a terminal case of cancer. A year and a half after the series finale, in which Cranston played cancer riddled Walter White, doctors have attributed Cranston\u2019s career\u2019s sickness to his minor role in 2014\u2019s reboot of the Godzilla franchise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a known carcinogen,\u201d said famed oncologist Dr Hugh Hormones. \u201cTaking small parts in disappointing remakes of classic movies is a surefire way to precipitate the disease. We warn actors time and time again, but after starring in long-running award-winning series, the temptation of getting back out there is just too great.\u201d\n\nFans of the actor have come out in huge support of his ailing career, sending sympathetic tweets and reposting photos they had taken with him \u2013 most of them show the man with a still-healthy looking career.\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad was always gonna be impossible to top,\u201d tweeted TheRealJohnJonson. \u201c#WeLoveYouWalterWhite\u201d\n\n\u201cBryan Cranston will forever be Walter White in my heart,\u201d posted JessePinkmanStillLives. \u201c#IBoughtGodzillaOnBluRay #ItWasOnSale #SupportCranston\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems that Cranston may not the only member of the cast of the AMC hit to be stricken with this rampant disease. Co-star Aaron Paul is said to be undergoing tests after symptoms that his own career might be deteriorating due to the incurable illness.\n\n\u201cAaron took few precautions in exposed himself to an even more severe carcinogen,\u201d said Dr Hormones, referring to Paul\u2019s part in the latest reimagining of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In it, Paul takes the role of Joshua, whose only lines include shouting the name \u201cMoses\u201d unclearly. This comes hot on the heels of his action film Need For Speed, a film about fast cars that is, curiously, not based on the video game series of the same name, and is a movie that most people aren\u2019t even aware exists.\n\nFamily members of both victims have announced that they will stand by their loved ones\u2019 sides throughout, and will \u201cfight this thing together.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaron and Bryan at least have each other to get through it with. Their careers have for so long been interlinked, and now they will until the end,\u201d said a family friend of Cranston\u2019s.\n\nReports, however, suggest that Paul may be exposing himself to yet another possibly fatal carcinogen, with rumors placing him in the role of the scarecrow in an as yet unannounced reboot of the Hollywood classic The Wizard of Oz.\n",

    "Taylor Swift Spending Millions of Dollars on New Boyfriend, Joe Alwyn: False News or True? | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nPop superstar Taylor Swift is buying new boyfriend Joe Alwyn by squandering millions of dollars on her lover according to some reports. Taylor has always been the bigger money earner in all of her relationships. Even though past boyfriends such as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Tom Hiddleston, and Calvin Harris were millionaires, their bank accounts still paled in comparison to Taylor\u2019s whopping $300 million estimated net worth.\n\nBut, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if it\u2019s true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.\n\nTaylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joe\u2019s parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.\n\nNow comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in London\u2019s affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.\n\nAlthough she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylor\u2019s home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Taylor Swift apparently doesn\u2019t mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singer\u2019s own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off.

But would the talkshow hostess really betray her (former) friend like that? Would things would Brad actually turn romantic?

    "Photos Of Angelina Jolie In A Wedding Dress Claim To Prove Quickie Marriage To Rando Brit After Brad Pitt Divorce\n\nPhotos of Angelina\u2019s Jolie\u2019s wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an In Touch front page cover claimed Angie got married to a British man just eight months after the split with Brad Pitt. This would be Angelina\u2019s fourth marriage if the tabloid\u2019s article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news.\n\nBack in April, In Touch ran a cover story declaring, \u201cAngelina\u2019s Shocking Surprise: Wedding In Cambodia! Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.\u201d The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolie\u2019s divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a \u201cwealthy, 40-something Brit.\u201d Angelina\u2019s dating of this \u201cphilanthropist business man\u201d was supposedly being \u201cshielded\u201d from the public \u201cby her closest friends.\u201d Worse, Angelina\u2019s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.\n\n\u201cA quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],\u201d claimed an unnamed \u201cfamily friend\u201d who is the supposed source for In Touch.\n\nWhile Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Brad\u2019s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that \u201cthis tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers\u201d and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angie\u2019s 2017 wedding rumors are \u201cbeyond ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn A Related Report By The Inquisitr\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s Children Will Soon Be Living Just Minutes Away From Brad Pitt In Los Feliz, Photo Reveals\n\nIs Brad Pitt Dating? Angelina Jolie Will Reportedly Be Unhappy If He Is\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s Kids Are Her Priority, Is She Ready to Co-Parent With Brad Pitt?\n\nAngelina Jolie Relying On Kids To Cheer Her Up After Brad Pitt Split \u2014 Divorce Details Revealed\n\nFast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelina\u2019s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.\n\nThe latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has \u201cquietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and she\u2019s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.\u201d The same \u201cfamily friend\u201d is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star\u2019s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not \u201cstanding in her way anymore.\u201d The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelina\u2019s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.\n\nIn this case, Gossip Cop claims the \u201ctabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine\u2019s dreadful reporting.\u201d The real problem is that it\u2019s not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch \u201chas simply been making it all up\u201d by generating fake news.\n\nWhat is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret \u201cfamily friend\u201d stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has \u201ccreated a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.\u201d It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked.

    "Jim Carrey Claims Donald Trump Is A 'Reptilian-Illuminati Blood Prince'\n\nJim Carrey\u00a0has told fans and supporters that Donald Trump is not human but is a \u201creptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile form\u201d and he has witnessed the president shapeshift \u201cin the flesh, before my very eyes, and in my opinion, as personal warning to me.\u201c\n\nSpeaking to supporters at the Signature Gallery in Las Vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition, \u201cSunshower\u201d, the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings.\n\n\u201cI am interested in what is behind the veil of reality, the real power structures that control the universe. I\u2019m no longer interested in the daily facade. I\u2019ve put everything I know into these paintings.\u201d\n\nCarrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at the\u00a0Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trump\u2019s associates for \u201cfailing to entertain\u201d the future president.\n\nBut according to Carrey, he was \u201cavoiding him like the plague\u201d because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,\u201d Carrey said.\n\nExplaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form \u201cat least three times\u201d while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.\n\n\u201cHis hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. When he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.\u201c\n\nCarrey says he believes Trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political Illuminati of which he is a \u201cblood prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis branch of the Illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from Bavaria,\u201d Carrey said, explaining that \u201cBavaria is Trump\u2019s ancestral homeland.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had proof of his claims, Carrey told his supporters to \u201cwatch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesn\u2019t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.\u201d\n\nCarrey also told his fans and supporters to \u201clook deeply\u201d at his artworks to \u201cdecipher their real meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1am, I\u2019m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. I\u2019ve never felt more at peace,\u201d Carrey said.\n\nCarrey\u2019s first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.\u00a0 I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing \u2018people\u2019 briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.\n\nI\u2019ve been told this by Californian news anchors, Ethiopian goatherds, and Australian Aboriginals, just to name a few.\u00a0 A Danish taxi driver described driving past a group of VIP guests at the 2014 Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look.\n\nIn Peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like Obama, David Cameron and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel.\n\nThe world\u2019s ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses.\u00a0 The evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.\n",

    "RED SEA: ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN ARMY FROM THE BIBLICAL EXODUS\nSuez | Egypt\u2019s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.\nThe team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.\n\nThe scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University\u2019s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.\n\nThe remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.\n\nThey estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.\n\nThis magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a highly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.\nMany clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.\n\nFirst of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.\n\nThe positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.\nThe sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.\n\nThis new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.\n\nThe famous biblical account of the \"Red Sea Crossing\" was dismisseded by many scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\nFor centuries, the famous biblical account of the \u201cRed Sea Crossing\u201d was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\n\n\u201cThis astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,\u201d Professor Gader said during the press conference.\n\u201cIt brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.\n\nA lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.\n",

According to Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn, Stein, who has been a regular legal busy body, lately, asked to approach the bench, and the motion was sustained. She went up to the judge and whispered that she had 3.5 million dollars in a briefcase in her car, directly from Hilary Clinton, adding, if they can recount the votes, then the Judge could be recounting her money. The Judge was not amused and ordered the bailiff to arrest Ms. Stein and then ruled that there would be no recount. Stein was led out of the courtroom, crying and in cuffs. Judge Bailey-Rihn then proceeded to explain to the courtroom about Pizzagate, and how she believed Hilary Clinton was a possible pedophile and a Reptilian shape shifter (citing David Ickes work, and the many Youtube videos on the subject) and would never get a recount in her jurisdiction, as long as she sat on the bench. Ms. Clinton could not be reached for comment. Baily-Rihn told us that there was most likely fraud in the election, and count, but since both sides do it, it works out to be mostly fair, in the end.

    "Brad Pitt Is Running Back to Jen Aniston During His Divorce From Angelina Jolie (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nAs Angelina Jolie continues to twist the knife in Brad Pitt's heart amid their impending divorce, the 53-year-old actor is running back to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston for support, In Touch has exclusively learned. A year after Angelina, 42, blindsided her husband of two years with divorce papers, the actress got candid with The New York Times, seemingly suggesting that her six children are better off without their father.\n\n\"[They're] the best friends I ever had,\" Angelina said of her children Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. \"Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.\"\n\nAside from shading her ex-husband for his lack of support, Angelina also subtly implied that the kids are doing just fine, even without Brad. \"None of it's easy,\" she continued. \"It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy. They're getting better.\"\n\nAngelina's public talk of their marriage's demise and smearing of his parenting skills and reputation is enough to send Brad right into the arms of his ex, 48-year-old Friends star Jen. Though she married fellow actor Justin Theroux in 2015, Brad's former wife of nearly five years seems willing to be there for her ex-husband.\n\n\"[He] wants and needs Jen in his life,\" a source tells In Touch exclusively, \"especially during this trying time.\" Justin, 46, isn't worried or the least bit threatened of Jen's friendship with her former beau. \"Brad wouldn't dream of breaking up Jen's marriage,\" the source reveals. \"Brad's leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed friendship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.\"\n\n\"Overall, Brad and Jen have a great deal in common,\" another source says, \"and have reached a level of closeness and understanding that they never thought was possible.\"But not everyone is comfortable with Brad and Jen's newfound kinship. Angelina has reportedly gotten wind of Brad's new confidante and is none too happy.\n\nBrad Pitt Jennifer Aniston Angelina Jolie Getty Images\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"She's furious,\" a source reveals of Angelina's reaction. \"Jen's always been Angelina's greatest rival when it comes to Brad. She hates the way that she has always been depicted as the evil femme fatale and Jen as the girl-next-door victim in the famous love triangle.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jen is allegedly reveling in Angelina's sour reaction. \"She's getting her well-deserved revenge,\" says the source. \"Jen feels Angelina lorded her relationship with Brad over her all these years. Jen's having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.\"\n\nExactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ \u2014 \"I was boozing too much,\" he said at the time \u2014 and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen \"was the person highest on his apology list,\" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.\n\n\"Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,\" the source continues. \"He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.\"\n\nOne more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that's still ranging on present-day.\n\nBrad Pitt Jennifer Aniston Getty Images\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,\" the source says, \"and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage \u2014 being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\"\n\nThe conversations re-instilled Jen's faith in Brad's sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing \"a sensitivity chip.\" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen's eyes.\n\n\"He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,\" the source says. \"It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.\"\n\nThe rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. \"Brad wants her involved again,\" says the source, \"and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.\"\n\n\"Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,\" the source continues. \"He's in a great place mentally and physically. He's in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he's shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.\"\n",

Michelle was traveling\u00a0in style, too!\n\nThe Air Force's fact sheet revealed that the luxury plane features \"a fully-enclosed stateroom,\" plus \"a changing area, private lavatory, separate entertainment system, two first-class swivel seats and a convertible divan that seats three and folds out to a bed.\"\n\nThe ENQUIRER has already revealed how the angry First Lady has earned the nickname \"Monster Michelle\" from staffers who watch in fear as she often goes on the warpath!\n\n\"Michelle has been labeled a 'ruthless mon\u00adster' for bullying not only Barack, but her loyal staff,\" said an insider. \"She dishes out abuse and punish\u00adment for the slightest of infractions. She doesn't give a damn who she humiliates - even the presi\u00addent!\"\n\nCaroline Kennedy Schlossberg\u00a0(pictured) crashed her family's Martha's Vineyard vacation The ENQUIRER exposed how Michelle Obama exploded in fury when(pictured) crashed her family's Martha's Vineyard vacation and made off with her husband! Sources said that Caroline - President Barack Obama's U.S. ambassador to Japan - showed up out of the blue during the last week of the Obamas' two-week vacation on the Massachusetts island.\n\n\"He immediately started flirting up a storm, while Michelle could barely keep her temper in check,\" a snitch told The ENQUIRER. \"Even though both their families were there, it was really intense!\"\n\nThe ENQUIRER has also caught the First Couple fighting over wild child Malia after the 17-year-old was recently caught at a boozy Brown University student bash. Eyewitnesses said the First Daughter was playing the popular campus drinking game called\u00a0Beer Pong!\n\n\"The First Lady and the President got into a screaming match over it, each blaming the other for letting their underage daughter attend a wild drinking party,\" said a political insider.\n\nMichelle also ignored the taxpayers when she stormed off for a trip to China with her mother and daughters - putting aside Obama's concerns over cost.\n\nInsiders told The ENQUIRER that Michelle (seen here in France)\u00a0couldn't stand to be around her husband after the president took an embarrassing \"selfie\" photo with sexy Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial service!\n\nThings got worse for Barack after Michelle discovered a secret love nest kept by her husband! Multiple insiders confirmed to The ENQUIRER that Obama was a regular at the swanky Jefferson Hotel, located a few blocks from the White House.\n\n\"The 'commander-in-cheat,' as he's known at the place, comes and goes so frequently that some hotel staffers call the door he uses the 'Barack entrance,'\" the insider divulged. \"It's easy for the president to get to - and, best of all, it has a secret entrance so he can come and go discreetly!\"\n",

He went on to spell out his next goal - eliminating the federal income tax.  \"Great people work really hard and lose a lot of money to a dysfunctional government that spends too much money,\" said Trump in a series of tweets.  \"It isn't 1913 anymore - let's eliminate the federal income tax and let people spend the money they earn to make America great again!\"",

The rapper thinks it was a pretty low thing for Taylor to do.\n\n\nKanye West, 40, isn\u2019t too happy that Taylor Swift, 27, targeted Kim Kardashian\u2018s Paris robbery situation in her music video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d, HL has EXCLUSIVELY learned. \u201cHe was upset that Taylor exploited Kim\u2019s robbery,\u201d a source close to the rapper explains. \u201cKanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.\u201d Ultimately, Ye\u2019 \u201cjust feels as though it\u2019s something that Taylor shouldn\u2019t have mocked.\u201d\n\n\nAs for the rest of the video? \u2014 Well, Kanye could care less. He and Kim, 36, weren\u2019t bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with, trying to dissect. However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s admitted that the robbery was \u201cmeant\u201d to happen to her. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. \u201cI know that was so meant to happen to me.

At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.\n\nWhen Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.\n\nThen, Taylor makes a gun-notion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands.\n\nKim was robbed at gunpoint.\n\nLater on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.\n\nWhen Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.\n\nSo, was Taylor really mocking the traumatic experience Kim endured? You can be the judge of that one. However, we\u2019ve decoded the video [seen above] to give you a clearer look at Tay\u2019s new work.\n\n",

    "TACO BELL MEAT\nMONTGOMERY, AL \u2013 After allegations of false advertising, further investigation causes Taco Bell to close its doors for good.\n\nTaco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general,  has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement.\n\nOn Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef.\n\nThe majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself.\n\nWeekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations.\n\nIt did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.\n\nWe all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.\n\nUpon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever. So go get as many doggy burritos and kitty fajitas as you can before they are gone for good.\n",

    "Pop insiders claim Justin Bieber cancelled long-running tour as he's considering starting his own church\n\nPOP insiders sensationally claim Justin Bieber may have cancelled his current long-running tour so he can start up his own CHURCH. Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was \"burned out.\" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots\n\nHe wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.\n\n\"[He\u2019s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\u2019s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own \u2013 starting his own church \u2013 we\u2019re not quite sure, but that\u2019s the word from an inside source.\u201d\n\nA statement on the star's Facebook site read: \u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.\n\nOne wrote: \" I'm sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well.

None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx\"\n\nOver the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.\n\nIn a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.\n\nHe believed that \"the almighty\" was telling him something.\n\nThat was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, \"get his stuff together.\"\n\nAnd just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.\n\nBieber said the name of \"Jesus\" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand's famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.\n\nHe fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.\n\nThe video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.\n\nBieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.\n\nHe claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.\n\nNow he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.\n\nBAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber's most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the \u201cOur Kids\u201d organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieber\u2019s moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face\n",
    "Kim Kardashian displays shocking hair loss after 'relying on weaves'\n\nShe's left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible post-pregnancy weight loss. \n\n\n\nBut it seems that Kim Kardashian's rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair. \n\n\n\nImages of the 33-year-old with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss, which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions.\n\nAnd according to hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina, it could be Kim's rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss. \n\n\n\nTatiana told MailOnline: 'It is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones, making it thicker and lusher, but when you have the baby most women find they\u00a0 seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal.\n\n'What with the rapid amount of weight Kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth, this may have accelerated the hair loss, giving sparser looking patches, we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline. \n\n\n\nThinning out: Hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina told MailOnline that Kim's rapid post-pregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks\n\n Where the real ends and the fake begins: The line of Kim's extensions could clearly be seen During pregnancy: Kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last May 'Birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume.' Tatiana added that Kim's apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with Traction Alopecia, and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesn't want to damage her hair further. \n\n She told MailOnline: 'In spite of giving instant full thick hair, weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp, often too heavy and tight, the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and Traction Alopecia, and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth.

    "School Choice Proven to Make a Big Difference in Students Lives\n\n\n\nSchool choice advocates have been finally proven correct.  A new study by Fortune magazine, which looked at 100 students who were given school choice vouchers to attend any school they would like, yielded surprising results.  Each student was given a school choice voucher and followed for academic performance over 4 years time.  The results?  Each students grade point average was 0.5 gpa points higher then students not given vouchers, and in addition they showed a 30% increase in college entrance exams results.  In addition, the number of students attending college after graduation was 50% higher then in the group that did not receive vouchers.  Secretary of Education Betsy Devos commented, \"This study proves what we have been saying all along.  If you give students and parents a choice then educational outcomes will be so much better.\"",

After Federer beat the younger tennis professional in three sets, the two players began to yell at each other. Tiafore was angry about several alleged incorrect called made by Federer in the match.

    "Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nAccording to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn't known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.\n\nStar Magazine's source claims, \"Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with\u00a0Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all.\u00a0He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.\"\n\nIs this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker \u2013 maybe a little too much.\n\nHe's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet.\n\nAnd trust me, they won't be. Rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. And if Star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. Sorry Twi-hards, but you know it's true.\n",
    "New Research Suggest That Men Who Cheat On Their Spouse Are More Honest And Emotional\nThis, of course, begs the question: Why? Why do men really cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they\u2019re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing, and the like?\nThe truth is that all sorts of dynamics can play into a man\u2019s decision to engage in infidelity. Generally, though, his choice to cheat is driven by one or more of the following factors:\nLove: Most men cheat because they just love so much they can\u2019t control themselves and sometimes this leads to cheating but he cheats because he a lover.\nHonesty: Sometime a man is so honest with another woman it might lead to a sexual encounter with another female.\nEmotional: Men try not to show their emotions but like anyone sometimes they need a shoulder to cry on and this may lead to accidental cheating\nAccidental: Most men don\u2019t cheat purposely sometimes is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.\nIt\u2019s Your Fault: Most men don\u2019t cheat because they are tempted but pushed by their spouse to cheat you have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what are you doing wrong\n\n",

Robert J. Bentley last month.\n\nMontgomery, AL \u2014 An Alabama boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Montgomery Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends Jefferson Davis High School. The teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Alabama state law called \u2018Self-Rape\u2019, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.\n\nThis is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley. Bently spoke with local news station WSFA 12 News about the charges against the boy.\n\n\u201cI applaud the Alabama District court systems here in Montgomery,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cThis is exactly why I implemented the state law of \u2018Self-Rape\u2019 last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. I plan to do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don\u2019t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the Alabama Southern District Court, broke down in tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\n\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\n\n\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d\n\u201cHelp!

Please send help immediately!\u201d\n\n33-year-old Martha Horner, mother to the young boy, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\n\n\u201cUp until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,\u201d Horner\u2019s mother said. \u201cBut somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil\u2019s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!\u201d\n\nMs. Horner\u2019s controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\n\n\u201cSTOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Martha Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,\u201d Childs told reporters. \u201cShe really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.\u201d\n\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\n\n\u201cFappy\u00ae has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things.

It\u2019s a slippery slope my friend, one day it\u2019s masturbating to porn, the next day it\u2019s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.\u201d Downey continued, \u201cThere is no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that I tell ya. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.\u201d\n\nDetectives confiscated pornography and lube found in the teenager\u2019s room as evidence.\n\nProsecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Alabama state law of Self-Rape A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 34-171 & 52-69 would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.\n\nHorner is currently being held at the Montgomery County Jail.

    "FKA Twigs Looks Miserable With Robert Pattinson At Cannes Film Festival | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nFKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson are reportedly going strong. The Twilight star and his fianc\u00e9e attended the 2017 Cannes Film Festival this week. The couple didn\u2019t look as happy as they are reported to be. It\u2019s been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.\n\nThey keep their relationship low-key for the most part. It\u2019s probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinson\u2019s latest movie Good Time.\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.\n\nThe Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.\n\nHe was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is \u201c100 percent worth it.\u201d\n\nShe told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support \u201cthe man that I love.\u201d She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesn\u2019t stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.\n\nCheck back with CDL for more Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs news and updates here.\n",
    "Jay-Z: 'Jesus Is Fake News; Lucifer Is Way Of Truth And Light'\n\n\u201cJesus Christ is the original fake news,\u201d according to Jay-Z, who claims \u201cJesus never walked the earth, y\u2019all being played\u201d and \u201cthe idea of Jesus is just a tool used by smart people to control dumb people.\u201d\n\nGoing as far as to claim \u201cLucifer is the way of truth and light\u201c, Jay-Z also credited his self-described \u201cnew humility and maturity\u201d to \u201cfully embracing my older bother, Lucifer.\u201d\n\nDuring an backstage rant at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans on Friday, Jay-Z also claimed Satanism has \u201cgotten a bad rap\u201d due to \u201cmentally challenged Christians and their desire to be slaves,\u201d but Satanism is actually \u201cthe highest form of being.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan that you just don\u2019t get in Christianity, because Christianity is a fake religion, built by assholes,\u201d Jay-Z said. \u201cHands up, how many Christians here have prayed to God for years and aint gotten nothing back, just silence and emptiness? Be honest. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nAs the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced, \u201cI can answer for y\u2019all because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me. I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success. The secret of the universe opens up to you. It is immediate and glorious.\u201d\n\nThe 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to \u201cDo what thou wilt\u201c.\n\nIt has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.\n\nThe religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; \u201cDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201c. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.\n\nJay-Z\u2019s Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.\n\nSince establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.\n\nThe incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.\n",

    "Kristen Stewart Drops 'Twilight' Movie Plans With Robert Pattinson: Lands New Role In 'Underwater' Thriller | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nIt looks like Kristen Stewart won't have any time on her hands to make another 'Twilight' movie with Robert Pattinson in the near future. In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'\n\nAccording to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.\n\nThen again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.\n\nPlus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.\n\nBut for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.\n\nWhat do you think of Kristen's new role in 'Underwater?' Does this mean that she's putting her 'Twilight' days behind her for good? Let us know what you think by dropping us a line with your thoughts in our comments section below.

    "The truth fades into the background\n\"FW: unbelievable food for thought.\"\n\n\"Just passing along info that came to me,\" it began. \"This is something to think about no matter what other concerns may be on your plate. If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard! Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nObama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city.

    "Kate Middleton Desperate To Save Prince William Marriage: Can't Let Go Of Pampered Royal Lifestyle | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nKate Middleton might be angry with her husband Prince William for embarrassing their family with his bizarre dancing and drinking during his ski trip, and all of the cheating rumors, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll be divorcing him anytime soon. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to Paris this weekend.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the Musee D\u2019Orsay in Paris. The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrew\u2019s University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.\n\nEyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour. Insiders say that Prince William, meanwhile, looked tired and tense.\n\nJudging from the photos that were snapped, there is some major tension between the Royal couple right now. \u00a0Kate looked absolutely miserable!\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility that Kate Middleton is worried that if she does divorce Prince William, she won\u2019t have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now. It\u2019s no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because she\u2019s Prince William\u2019s wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kate\u2019s life won\u2019t be the same.\n\nShe won\u2019t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, that\u2019s probably what she\u2019ll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she won\u2019t be in it anymore.\n\nPlus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, there\u2019s a good chance that she\u2019ll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband\u2019s behavior because she probably doesn\u2019t have any other choice. It\u2019s either this or she goes back to her mother Carole Middleton\u2019s party favor business.

    "Robots Taking Over the World \n\nRobots are slowly taking over the workforce of the world.  Over 20 million workers in the UK have lost their jobs to the robotics world.  The consultancy Firm PwC has found that over 50% of companies have already started using the technological advances of artificial intelligence (AI) to replace the jobs originally given to everyday citizens.  Former employees of these companies are at a complete loss.  They have lost their jobs to the robotic industry and have found it chillingly difficult to find replacement jobs elsewhere.  Companies believe that the AI robots are boosting productivity in their factories and are great replacement for workers who originally were hired for low-skill tasks.  PwC says this is just the start of the incorporation of AI in society.  Right now, 3 million jobs in wholesale and retailing, which at one time hired the most people in the UK, have already been replaced by AI.  Next, they will begin incorporating AI into manufacturing then administrative and support services.  Soon, companies will be using AI for 95% of the work within their company.  Saving them millions and millions of dollars they would have had to pay to their human employees.",

    "\nWhite Witch warns Angelina against using spells to woo back Brad\n\n\nA white witch from North London has urged\u00a0Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.\n\nBack in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.\n\n'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.\n\n'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'\n\nCarrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,\n\nIt was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.\n\nCarrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.\n\n'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.\n\n'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'\n\n'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.\n\nCarrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else\u2019s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won\u2019t work.\u00a0 'When a person works magic to \"keep\" or \"get\" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said.\u00a0 Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.\u00a0 Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.\u00a0 May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart\u2019s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?\u00a0 Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.\u00a0 When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.'\u00a0Then let the candle burn all the way down.\n\n'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.\n\n'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.\n\n'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.\n\n'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.\n\nAngelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.\n\nShe acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the\u00a0left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.\n\nThe process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.\n\nCarrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.\n\n'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.\n\n'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the \"magic\" of another culture.'\n\nThe star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat,\u00a0purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.\n\n'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.\n\n'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.\n\nIt's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.\n\n'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.\n\n'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'\n\nAssisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.\n\n'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'\n\nWhen working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are \u2013 or have been \u2013 witches.\n\n'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.\n\n'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.\n",

    "Tom Hiddleston Still Embarrassed About Taylor Swift: Ignores Fans and Media at Comic-Con | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nFor the past several years, actor Tom Hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the San Diego Comic-Con. But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston\u2019s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, \u201cThor\u201d has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.\n\nAlthough Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.\n\nThis is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.\n\nAudience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn\u2019t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom\u2019s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn\u2019t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.\n\nMany believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom\u2019s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.\n\nOf course, Tom and Taylor Swift\u2019s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported\u00a0that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.\n",
    "Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton Clash Again: Duchess Scared of Difficult Pregnancy, Adopting Second 'Royal' Baby - Reports\n\nKate Middleton is said to have miscarried. However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George's mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.\n\nThe Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.\n\nCeleb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she's not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.\u00a0 Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!\n\nBecause what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate's attitude is making the Queen see red. \u00a0The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy. \u00a0Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family's bloodline would be considered \"a spare\" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.\n\nThis is not the first time that Kate Middleton's ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine's July 14 feature \"Tormented by the Queen,\" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton's plans to move baby Prince George out of London.\n\nKate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.\n\n\"The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments\u00a0are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate,\"\u00a0shared\u00a0royal family sources with Vanity Fair.\n",

    "Jake Gyllenhaal reticent on topic of his relationship with Ryan Reynolds\n\nJake Gyllenhaal was interviewed last week by Michael Strahan about his new romantic comedy film, \"Loaf\", which co-stars his rival Ryan Reynolds. Ryan plays Dr. David Jordan, the romantic interest of Gyllenhaal's character in this tale of Mars and Venus. The character was inexperienced as a doctor and felt out of his element in this new relationship and in his new profession. Gyllenhaal described Ryan's character as a romantic who refused to be brought down to earth no matter how things are going in this country or in the world today. Each character believes he has his feet on the ground, but both are prone to flying off into outer space when things get tough and they must face life in a war-torn area that feels like living on Mars with a Venusian partner.

    "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Maybe Got Secret-Married Last April\n\nIn September, Miley Cyrus told The Sun on Sunday that she and her fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth had no wedding plans anytime soon. \"I don\u2019t envision marriage,\" she told The Sun on Sunday. \"I\u2019m 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married].\" (Her mother Tish Cyrus made the same point when asked about a rumored Miley-Liam elopement in June, too.)\n\nBut, if this wild rumor from Australia\u2019s NW Magazine is true (via The Sun and The Daily Mail), the lack of wedding plans may just be because Cyrus and Hemsworth already had their wedding. In April. A source told the outlet that \"six months ago, way back in late April,\" the two secretly had \"a very intimate ceremony at their house in Malibu. I'm told only a handful of people were there and they're still the only ones who know.\" Hm\u2026\n\nCyrus was first spotted wearing a wedding band-like ring in July.\n\nShe was recently photographed with Hemsworth wearing her band with her engagement ring:\n\nHemsworth was first photographed with one in August.\n\nBut People reports these are just promise rings. \"He [Liam] wears that ring as more of a 'promise' to Miley, but they are not officially married,\" a source told E! in August when Hemsworth's ring first debuted. \"The only thing that is missing is the legal piece of paper. The pair is not focused on planning a wedding at this time. They are more focused on making their love as strong as possible.\"\n\nBut, given Hemsworth also publicly denied being engaged to Cyrus when Cyrus was probably engaged to him and definitely wearing his engagement ring in April 2016, only those two really know what\u2019s going on.\n",

Anna's now 64 years old, and while she's still got plenty of years to keep running Vogue, her reign isn't going to last forever. Eventually, she will have to find a successor, and according to a report from Radar Online, that successor will be Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nNow, before you laugh yourself to sleep, listen to Radar's reasoning. Sarah and Anna are friends, and have been friends for a very long time, thanks to the long running popularity of Sex and the City. Vogue owes a huge debt to the show for putting it on the map, especially since the magazine didn't use to be the household name it is now.\n\nAnyway, Radar's source explains, \"Anna is\u00a0worrying colleagues who believe she has found her true successor in Sarah!\u00a0It's a surprising idea, but one that is not entirely a joke.

Sarah's very fashion savvy, and while she doesn't seem like she'd be able to run Vogue as well as Anna [who would?], she does have the contacts and image to keep the brand name strong.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is Anna Wintour grooming Sarah Jessica Parker to take over Vogue for her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.\n",

    "Superman to Not Appear in \"Justice League\" Movie\n\nWhen the new trailer for \"Justice League\" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the \"Justice League\" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning.   Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that \"It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him. \"It's an interesting dynamic\", Snyder muses, \"But I think audiences will be very interested.\"",
    "Is Aspartame Responsible for \u2018An Epidemic of Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus\u2019?\nI have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on \u201cASPARTAME marketed as \u2018NutraSweet\u2019, \u2018Equal\u2019, and \u2018Spoonful\u201d\u2018. In the keynote address by the EPA, they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus, and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States. I explained that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.\n\nWhen the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants). The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis; thus people are being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, where methanol toxicity is.\n\nIn the case of systemic lupus, we are finding it has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. Also, with methanol toxicity, the victims usually drink three to four 12 oz. cans of them per day, some even more. In the cases of systemic lupus, which is triggered by ASPARTAME, the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit. The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree, that sometimes it becomes life threatening.\n\nWhen we get people off the aspartame, those with systemic lupus usually become asymptomatic. Unfortunately, we can not reverse this disease. On the other hand, in the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear. We have seen cases where their vision has returned and even their hearing has returned. This also applies to cases of tinnitus. During a lecture I said \u201cIf you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss \u2014 you probably have ASPARTAME DISEASE!\u201d\n\nPeople were jumping up during the lecture saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got this, is it reversible?\u201d It is rampant. Some of the speakers at my lecture even were suffering from these symptoms. In one lecture attended by the Ambassador of Uganda, he told us that their sugar industry is adding aspartame! He continued by saying that one of the industry leader\u2019s son could no longer walk \u2013 due in part by product usage!\n\nWe have a very serious problem. Even a stranger came up to Dr. Espisto (one of my speakers) and myself and said, \u2018Could you tell me why so many people seem to be coming down with MS? During a visit to a hospice, a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence.\n\nHere is the problem. There were Congressional Hearings when aspartame was included in 100 different products. Since this initial hearing, there\nhave been two subsequent hearings, but to no avail. Nothing as been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Now there are over\n5,000 products containing this chemical, and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED!!!!!\n\nAt the time of this first hearing, people were going blind. The methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye. Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic DEADLY POISONS!!! Unfortunately, it just takes longer to quietly kill, but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems. Aspartame changes the brain\u2019s chemistry. It is the reason for severe seizures. This drug changes the dopamine level in the brain. Imagine what this drug does to patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s Disease. This drug also causes Birth Defects.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to take this product. It is NOT A DIET PRODUCT!!! The Congressional record said, \u201cIt makes you crave carbohydrates and will make you FAT\u201d. Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs.\n\nAspartame is especially deadly for diabetics. All physicians know what wood alcohol will do to a diabetic. We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy, when in fact, it is caused by the aspartame. The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control, causing many patients to go into a coma. Unfortunately, many have died. People were telling us at the Conference of the American College of Physicians, that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma. Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control. Thus, the patients suffered acute memory loss and eventually coma and death.\n\nMemory loss is due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. Thus it goes past the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, \u201cThe ingredients stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS\u201d (Health Press 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning, has also written a book entitled DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE\u201d (1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts tells how aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and indeed it is. As the hospice nurse told me, women are being admitted at 30 years of age with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Dr. Blaylock and Dr. Roberts will be writing a position paper with some case histories and will post it on the Internet.\n\nAccording to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, \u2018We are talking about a plague of neurological diseases caused by this deadly poison\u201d.\n\nDr. Roberts realized what was happening when aspartame was first marketed. He said \u201chis diabetic patients presented memory loss, confusion, and severe vision loss\u201d. At the Conference of the American College of Physicians, doctors admitted that they did not know. They had wondered why seizures were rampant (the phenylalanine in aspartame breaks down the seizure threshold and depletes serotonin, which causes manic depression, panic attacks, rage and violence).\n\nJust before the Conference, I received a FAX from Norway, asking for a possible antidote for this poison because they are experiencing so many problems in their country. This poison is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide. Fortunately, we had speakers and ambassadors at the Conference from different nations who have pledged their help. We ask that you help too. Print this article out and warn everyone you know. Take anything that contains aspartame back to the store. Take the \u201cNO ASPARTAME TEST\u201d and send us your case history.\n",
    "Mexicans Are Chomping at the Bit to Stop NAFTA Renegotiation Meetings\n\nMexico has been unfairly gaining from NAFTA as it stands now, placing profits derived from the measure as the main source of the country's economic growth. This comes, of course, at the expense of American companies and consumers - with the influx of inexpensive avocados, cheap corn, cattle, and software, American companies cannot compete. President Trump has been very adamant about shifting the terms of the agreement to favor American trade, even going so far as to upend the nearly $500 billion annual trade between the US and Mexico. Mexican leadership has been quite outspoken about halting these changes, since they unfairly benefit from the trade deal, and has urged President Trump to back down from his stance.",

    "Jennifer Aniston on the Exact Moment She Had It With the Pregnancy Rumors\n\nIn July, Jennifer Aniston powerfully spoke out against the constant tabloid pregnancy rumors about her that have circulated through the years, in an op-ed for Huffington Post. \"For the record, I am not pregnant,\" she wrote in it. \"What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'\"\n\n\"If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.\"\n\nThe post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn't even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. \"You know how we kind of write and don't necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],\" Aniston said.\n\nShe and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of \"nowhere\". But \"we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn't know what was happening. I kept thinking, 'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I've had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.\"\n\nShe then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:\n\nI think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, \"Get to work, lady!\" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it's like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the \"She's jealous of this person, and she's depressed, and oh my god she's never going to have a...\" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we've just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It's up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.\n",

She\u2019s scaring the hell out of everyone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about Sonny nowadays,\u201d said the source.\n\nMost disturbing of all, \u201cshe\u2019s been paying secret visits to Sonny\u2019s grave and giving away many of her possessions,\u201d added the source.\n\nSonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, \u201cI Got You Babe\u201d and \u201cThe Beat Goes On.\u201d\n\nHe was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cCher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe\u2019s even cried, \u2018I\u2019m ready to be with Sonny again.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nAs The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning \u201cMoonstruck\u201d star \u2013 who is worth a reported $320 million \u2013 is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.\n\nAt the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a \u201cdevastated\u201d Cher canceling 23 shows.\n\nDealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the \u201cMask\u201d star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.\n\nShe\u2019s also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer\u2019s longtime battle with the Epstein\u2013Barr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.\n\nAt the time of her first bout with the viral infection \u2013 during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s \u2013 Cher told a friend: \u201cThis disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed \u2013 and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!\u201d\n\nAs The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.\n\nWhen contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that she\u2019s headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.\n\nBut recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. \u201cCher\u2019s been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cThey planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.\n\n\u201cNow, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. She\u2019s calling it the visit she and Sonny \u2018always wanted but never had.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nDespite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.\n\n\u201cCher has a golf cart that she loves,\u201d said one local. \u201cShe used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nOther Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems \u201cvery isolated,\u201d while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.\n\n\u201cHer management even went to Cher to say she\u2019s got to tone it down, because she\u2019s coming across as angry,\u201d another source said. \u201cBut she told them to f\u2013k off.\u201d\n\nAdded the friend: \u201cIt\u2019s like Cher knows it\u2019s all over, and she\u2019s ready to go. She\u2019s hoping Sonny will be there waiting for her in Heaven.\u201d\n",

    "Miley Cyrus Wedding Rumors: Will Miley Force Liam Hemsworth To Sign A Prenup?\n\nWedding rumors for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.\n\nMiley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn't matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn't stand the test of time.\n\n\"They've had heated arguments over this,\" a source told the magazine. \"He's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. He's assured Miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.\"\n\nIt's only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley's wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.\n\nOn the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.\n\nAfter reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. \"The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,\" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It's unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?\n\nSo far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren't hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year's holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.\n\nWill the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let's just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.\n",

    "Leah Remini Opens Up About Her Friendship With Jennifer Lopez And The Scientology Connection\n\nJennifer Lopez and ex-Scientologist Leah Remini are the best of friends. They have known each other for several years and have been through a lot. Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isn\u2019t a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is \u201cdisconnecting.\u201d\n\nWhen a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the church\u2019s rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.\n\nLeah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such \u201cbig names.\u201d Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.\n\nThe Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leah\u2019s show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.\n",

    "Justin Bieber pokes fun at himself after stepping out with an wet mark\n\nAccidents happen, but this star is not sorry about it.\n\nJustin Bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before.\n\nThe 23-year-old shared an Instagram of himself and Adam Sandler's character Billy Madison on Thursday to 'fess' up to peeing in his pants.\n\nJust a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area, Justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie Billy Madison.\n\nUsing a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie, Justin captioned the side-by-side image: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.'\n\nIn the popular comedy, Adam's character - an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his father's business - pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants.\n\nThe pee or not pee drama all started after the 24-year-old was seen in West Hollywood, California, with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats.\n\nThe Sorry star's stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost $700 grey Vetements sweatpants.\n\nThe star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex Selena Gomez's new relationship with The Weeknd.\n\nJustin made a beeline for his matte black Range Rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says Stealth Rover.\n\nWhile in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area, Justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice.\n\nObviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants, the platinum blond singer then headed to Earthbar.\n\nThere he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the area's busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world.\n\nAside from his stained designer sweatpants, Justin wore a white T-shirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of Nike Air Huarache.\n\nAs is his style these days, the Baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses.\n\nJustin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night.\n\nIt was fortunate he opted for jeans, as rumored on and off again love interest Kourtney Kardashian was also there.\n\nThere was also no missing Kourt with the 37-year-old wearing a sheer bra-flashing top to the religious service.\n\nKourtney and the much younger pop star have been linked since 2015 but neither have confirmed if they are romantic or just good friends.\n",

That's the way I'd put it best, I think.\" You think?\n\n\"I think that the funny thing is, [Harry] would say the same thing about me because he doesn't really listen to hip-hop music, whereas it's like my song's more \u2018Rack City' and his song is more of a different era to something I'd listen to, I guess.\"\n\nFair enough, Liam, and thank you for the clarification.\nJust a few days ago, while promoting \"Sign of the Times,\" Harry explained to USA Today that writing his new album was \"like therapy.\"\n\n\"I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things.\"\n\nWell, it looks like Harry and his legions of fans are happy with his new music regardless of what any of his former bandmates think!\n",

    "Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton are already thinking about moving out of Kensington Palace. That\u2019s because William doesn\u2019t want his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. Instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible.\n\nIn his interview with British GQ, Prince William said that the most important thing for him is knowing that Prince George and Princess Charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world.\n\nIn other words, he doesn\u2019t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. And while Prince William and Kate Middleton haven\u2019t fully moved in to Kensington Palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. Apparently, London is the last place that William wants to be with Kate and their kids.\n\nOf course, if Prince William and Kate Middleton do end up moving from Kensington Palace, royal observers wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s taken them this long to move back to London after having spent the last several years at Anmer Hall. Prince William has made it no secret that he doesn\u2019t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up.\n\nIdeally, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would love to move back to Anmer Hall. It was a gift given to them by Queen Elizabeth. The property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to run around in all day and night.\n\nBut of course for Prince William this won\u2019t be easy. He can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future King of England.

And as much as he would love to return to Anmer Hall in the future, it might not happen.\n\nAll of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in London. That\u2019s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later William will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do.\n\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here!\n",
    "Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry\n\nRobert Pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, \u201cGood Time\u201d. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.\n\nIn the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.\n\nWhen the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting \u201cBravo\u201d and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.\n\nOf course everyone knows Robert\u2019s big break came with the 2008 film, \u201cTwilight\u201d where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The \u201cTwilight\u201d movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.\n\nFor the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, \u201cRemember Me\u201d and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d.\n\nSince the ending of the \u201cTwilight\u201d and it\u2019s sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, \u201cAbduction\u201d, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with \u201cScream Queens\u201d.\n\nOther actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after \u201cTwilight\u201d with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.\n\nKristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director.\n\nWith the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, I\u2019m sure Robert Pattinson is glad his \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d appears to be over.\n\n",
