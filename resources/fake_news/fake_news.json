    "Immigration Controversy Could Drive Up College Costs\n\n\nThe University of Central Missouri is one of many higher-education institutions to express support for its Muslim students after President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nLike many of the rest, it has reasons for feeling apprehensive that are not solely about empathy.\n\nThe university hosted more than 3,700 international students last year, most of them paying full tuition that helps subsidize domestic students. Losing even a portion of those - something there are signs may already be starting to happen nationwide - would have a significant financial impact that could ultimately drive up costs for Americans.",

There's always a lot of tears  but we also have bonfires and play games and get to tell the family member leaving how much we love them -- and  you know  completely embarrass them.\"",

    "Solar-powered 'skin' could make prosthetics more real\n\nMany people try to stay out of the sun. But if a new type of solar-powered electronic skin makes its way onto prosthetics, wearers will definitely want those rays shining on their limbs.\n\nResearchers are already working to create smart skin that embeds sensors that mimic the tactile feedback of human skin, making it possible for amputees to feel pressure, temperature and even dampness. But how to power the futuristic material?\n\nA team from the University of Glasgow in the UK has come up with a version that harnesses the sun's rays. Because it produces its own energy from a natural source, the engineers say, the electronic skin would operate longer than similar materials powered by batteries or tethered to a power source that would also limit portability, clearly a key feature of any everyday prosthetic or touch-sensitive robot on the go.",

Technology companies like Mint and Betterment have been eager to slurp up this data  mainly by building services that let people link all their various bank-account and credit-card information.

Both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions.",
